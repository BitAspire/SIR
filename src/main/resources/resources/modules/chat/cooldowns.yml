# Chat Cooldowns Configuration

cooldowns:
  # Default Cooldown Settings
  default:
    # Permission and Priority
    permission: DEFAULT           # No special permission needed
    priority: 0                   # Lowest priority level

    # Spam Check System
    check:
      enabled: false              # Spam detection toggle
      count: 5                    # Maximum messages allowed
      time-limit: 10              # Time window in seconds
      commands:                   # Actions when limit reached
        - "kick {player}"         # Example: Kicks spammer

    # Basic Cooldown
    time: 5                       # Seconds between messages

    # Notification Messages
    messages:
      - '<P> &cYou can not send another message in {time} seconds.'

# How Cooldowns Work:
# 1. Basic Cooldown (time):
#    - Players must wait 'time' seconds between messages
#    - Applies to all messages
#
# 2. Spam Check System (when enabled):
#    - Monitors 'count' messages within 'time-limit' seconds
#    - If exceeded, executes specified commands
#    - Example: 5 messages in 10 seconds = kick

# Priority System:
# - Higher priority overrides lower
# - 0 = lowest priority (default)
# - Multiple cooldowns use the highest priority

# Placeholders:
# {player} - Player's name
# {time}   - Remaining cooldown time

# Important Notes:
# - DEFAULT permission applies to everyone
# - Spam check is separate from basic cooldown
# - Commands execute as console
# - Multiple messages supported
