# Join/Quit Message Configuration

# Default Message Control
default-messages:
  disable-join: true     # Disable vanilla join messages
  disable-quit: true     # Disable vanilla quit messages

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING ⚠️
# These settings ONLY affect vanilla Minecraft messages
# S.I.R. custom join/quit messages are controlled separately
# This will NOT disable custom messages configured in S.I.R.

# Anti-Spam Cooldowns
cooldown:
  join: 0       # Delay between join messages (seconds)
    # 0 = No delay

  between: 0    # Delay between join/quit messages
    # 0 = No delay (default)
  # Prevents quick join/quit spam

  quit: 0       # Delay between quit messages
  # 0 = No delay

# Cooldown System Explained:
# 1. Join Cooldown:
#    - Affects consecutive join messages
#    - Player A joins → wait → Player B joins
#
# 2. Between Cooldown:
#    - Controls join→quit message timing
#    - Player joins → wait → Player quits
#
# 3. Quit Cooldown:
#    - Manages consecutive quit messages
#    - Player A quits → wait → Player B quits

# Use Cases:
# - Prevent chat spam from rapid joins/quits
# - Control message flow in high-traffic servers
# - Reduce visual clutter in chat
# - Manage connection spam attempts

# Important Notes:
# 1. Cooldowns are in seconds
# 2. 0 means no cooldown
# 3. Affects ALL players
# 4. Independent of S.I.R. messages

# Best Practices:
# 1. Set reasonable cooldowns based on server size
# 2. Monitor for message suppression
# 3. Adjust based on user feedback
# 4. Consider peak hours
# 5. Balance spam prevention vs information
